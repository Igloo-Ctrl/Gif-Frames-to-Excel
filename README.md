# Gif-Frames-to-Excel
A programmatic way of converting the RGB values of each individual pixel in a GIF to data that can be further processed and inserted into an excel document. The process, besides procurring the gif, resizing and splitting is all done automatically, assuming the correct paramaters for your specific case are accounted for.

Note: the colouring and formatting of the excel file was done via VBA macros.
